# Wave 6 — Documentation Refresh

## Status: Complete

This wave focused on updating and finalizing key documentation files to ensure they are accurate and aligned with the current state of the repository.

### 1. Command Appendix (`docs/command_appendix.csv`)

- **Finalized URLs:** The `LearnURL` column was populated for every cmdlet in the appendix. Each link now points to the official Microsoft Learn documentation page for the corresponding command.
- **Updated Modules:** The `Module` column for Microsoft Graph cmdlets was updated to reflect their specific sub-modules (e.g., `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`, `Microsoft.Graph.Users`) for better clarity.

### 2. `CHANGELOG.md`

- A new version entry, `[0.2.0]`, was added to the changelog.
- This entry documents the significant work completed in Waves 3, 4, and 5, including:
  - PSScriptAnalyzer fixes.
  - Naming convention validation.
  - Comprehensive updates to comment-based help.
  - Finalization of the command appendix.

### 3. `README.md`

- The `README.md` file was reviewed and found to be accurate and up-to-date. No changes were required.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Wave 7 (Final Assembly).
