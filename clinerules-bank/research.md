# Research / Web Lookup Overlay

- Use system-approved commands (e.g., `curl -s`, `Invoke-WebRequest`) and cite sources inline with URLs.
- Summarize key findings; highlight potential conflicts with repo rules.
- Prefer official docs (Microsoft, AWS, Google, NIST) before community blogs; flag uncertainty for user review.
- Never paste sensitive tenant data into external queries; keep queries generic.
